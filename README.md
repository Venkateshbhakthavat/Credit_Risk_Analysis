# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

Fast Lending a PEER to Peer lending services company wants to use machine learning to predict the credit risk. They would increase the accuracy and reliability of good customers and reduce their default risk 


Purpose of this analysis is well defined (4 pt)

Results:- Since Credit risk falls under unbalanced classification problem. We need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate the models.


There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models (15 pt)

Summary:

Over Sampling with Naive - Precision of 0.01, Sensitivity of 0.62 & F1 score is 0.02. 

SMOTE - Precision of 0.01, Sensitivity of 0.61 & F1 score is 0.02.

Undersampling - Precision of 0.01, Sensitivity of 0.65 & F1 score is 0.01.

Combination sampling - Precision of 0.01, Sensitivity of 0.70 & F1 score is 0.02.

BalancedRandomForestClassifier - Precision is 0.04. Sensitivity is 0.67 (67% Bad loans detected). F1 Score - 0.07

EasyEnsembleClassifier - Precision is 0.09. Sensitivity is 0.92 (67% Bad loans detected). F1 Score - 0.16
